# Pi Approximation Using Monte Carlo Method (Modelling and Optimization Homework)
## author: Antonio Badilla-Olivas

This project uses the Monte Carlo method to approximate the value of Pi. The Monte Carlo method is a statistical technique that allows for numerical approximations of parameters and is used here to estimate the value of Pi. It uses parallelism to speed up the process.
